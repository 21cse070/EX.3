    <p1 style="color:black;text-align:left;font-size:25px;">
                Today is a landmark day for Apollo as we complete 39 years of dedicated patient care. Over the years Apollo has been he pioneer of healthcare in India, and we are humbled by the love and trust placed in us by over 200 million patients and their families.
                It has motivated us to put in tireless efforts and remain unwavering in our commitment to bring you the best healthcare in the world.

As we enter our 40th year, I want to re-affirm this commitment - Apollo will always bring you the best healthcare in the world, no matter what.
This is our mission. Today with over 10,000 beds, 400 clinics, 5,000 pharmacies and our 24/7 digital channel, we bring the best, most comprehensive omnichannel care to you wherever you are and whenever you need it.


We have the best doctors and the most care-focused teams coupled with the most advanced equipment, cutting-edge treatments and technologies, including Proton therapy, robotic surgeries, artificial intelligence and more. These ensure we can get you healthy quickly so you can get back to leading a happy and fulfilling life.
<br>
<br>



As our country emerges from the pandemic, Apollo will focus its efforts on the NCD epidemic, including diabetes, CVD and cancer. Sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets have made our youth susceptible to these chronic diseases.
Over 50% of premature mortality in India in the 30+ age group can be attributed to NCDs. India will spend around $5 trillion by 2030 to combat NCDs.

To become a developed nation, we must first ensure that we are a healthy nation, and Apollo is committed to battling the NCD epidemic to ensure the youth of our nation remains healthy and can accelerate our nation’s development.
But there is much more to be done, and I believe we are just getting started. Over the next 4 decades, we will work towards making healthcare more proactive and preventive. In fact, our measure of success would be if you never need to visit a hospital at all.
We’ve made significant investments in this area with ProHealth. It is a unique program that combines artificial intelligence, cutting-edge diagnostics and physician evaluation to provide you insights into your health risks as well as a personalised path to prevention.

<h4>2.Asia’s First Radical Pleurectomy With HITHOC Was Successfully Performed On An Adolescent With Ewing’s Sarcoma At Apollo Proton Cancer Centre.</h4>
<br>

In the early 2020, 16-year-old adolescent was detected to have Ewing’s Sarcoma of the left intra thoracic cavity for which the patient underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiation with maintenance chemotherapy.

<h4>3.Asia’s First Brain Bypass Surgery Was Successfully Performed By Apollo Proton Cancer Centre On 8-Year-Old Twins Diagnosed With A Rare Disease.</h4>

This was the first case witnessed in Asia of Moyamoya disease—a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder in which the carotid artery in the skull is blocked or narrowed—reduces blood flow to the brain.
The condition was diagnosed in eight-year-old twin girls. Over the years, one of the twins developed vague symptoms like jerky movements in the right hand and leg. The persistent symptoms concerned parents who sought the neurologist’s opinion.
The MRI scan of the brain showed that the blood supply to the brain was significantly compromised on both sides of the brain, especially on the left.

<h4>4.Apollo Cancer Centers Launched ArtCan, An Initiative To Raise Awareness About Breast Cancer.</h4>

Through ancient Kerala Mural Art, 8 steps of self-breast examination brought attention to the issue of breast cancer.
Each frame reflected the story of a woman who discovered this condition while performing a self-breast examination, acted on time and defeated cancer.
These eight steps have also been depicted in a book format called ‘Chitra Sutra’.
